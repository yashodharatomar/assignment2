Assignment Part 2: Building an Agent that can perform smart actions based on the user’s query. Extend the service and host another endpoint for the agent.
The agent should be reliably able to decide when to call the VectorDB and when to not. Ex: Hello -> should not call the VectorDB.
Secondly, introduce at least ONE more action / tool in your system that the Agent can invoke based on the user’s query. Bonus points for more creative actions!
